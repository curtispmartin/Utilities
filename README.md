# Utilities
Some code I've written & attempted to generalize for future usage. 

## Cell_Assays
Contains scripts developed to speed up assay analyses. 
- `assay_BCA.py` translates intensity data generated by BCA assay (or similar) & converts to concentrations. Also provides dilutions if/when necessary. 
- `assay_BCA_template.py` provides template needed for running `assay_BCA.py` -- Plan experiment accordingly! 

## Mass_Spectrometry
Contains scripts developed to analyze mass spectrometry (MS) data in a user-friendly way (as much as possible w/o creating an .exe).
- `analysis_MS.py` creates volcano plots using MS data. Requires multiple user inputs which are requested interactively during execution. 
- `msenv.yml` provides a virtual environment used for this code. Add virtual enviornment using `conda env create --file=msenv.yml`

## RFR
-`fxn_RFR.py` enables simple constructions & validation of a time-series random forest model using the `build_model` class. 
- `env_RFR.yml` provides a virtual environment for simple use of code. Just clone & go. 

## SQL
- `fxn_SQL.py` provides a `pull_SQL()` function which acts as a wrapper for simple SQL pulls. Great for folks who don't know SQL well but need to access server quickly... Will need slight modifications if manual user credentials required. 
- `env_SQL.py` provides a virtual environment for simple use of code. Just clone & go.
