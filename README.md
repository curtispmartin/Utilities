# Utilities
Some code I've written which may be useful in the future.

## RFR

### `fxn_RFR.py`
Creation of a class object (`build_model`) which enables simple construction & validation of a time-series random forest model. 

### `env_RFR.yml`
Provides a virtual environment for simple use of code. Just clone & go. 

## SQL

### `fxn_SQL.py`
Provides function (`pull_SQL`) which acts as a wrapper for simple SQL pulls. Great for folks who don't know SQL well but need to access server quickly.

### `env_SQL.py`
Provides a virtual environment for simple use of code. Just clone & go.
