# Utilities
Some code I've written & attempted to generalize for future usage. 

## Cell_Assays
Contains scripts developed to speed up assay analyses. 

### `assay_BCA.py` 
Translates intensity data generated by BCA assay (or similar) & converts to concentrations. Also provides dilutions if/when necessary. 

### `assay_BCA_template.py` 
Provides template needed for running `assay_BCA.py` -- Plan experiment accordingly! 


## Mass_Spectrometry
Contains scripts developed to analyze mass spectrometry (MS) data in a user-friendly way (as much as possible w/o creating an .exe).

### `analysis_MS.py` 
Creates volcano plots using MS data. Requires multiple user inputs which are requested interactively during execution. 

### `msenv.yml` 
Provides a virtual environment used for this code. Add virtual enviornment using `conda env create --file=msenv.yml`


## RFR

### `fxn_RFR.py`
Creation of a class object (`build_model`) which enables simple construction & validation of a time-series random forest model. 

### `env_RFR.yml`
Provides a virtual environment for simple use of code. Just clone & go. 


## SQL

### `fxn_SQL.py`
Provides function (`pull_SQL`) which acts as a wrapper for simple SQL pulls. Great for folks who don't know SQL well but need to access server quickly.

### `env_SQL.py`
Provides a virtual environment for simple use of code. Just clone & go.
